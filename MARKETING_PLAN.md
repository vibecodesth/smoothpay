**Date:** 2026-02-08  
**Goal:** 100+ waitlist signups  
**Timeline:** 2 weeks  
**Budget:** $0 (100% organic)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Day 1 - TODAY)

### ✅ Technical Setup
- [x] Landing page live: https://smoothpay-nu.vercel.app
- [ ] Email capture working (integrate Supabase or Google Sheets)
- [ ] Thank you page after signup
- [ ] Auto-responder email (welcome email)
- [ ] Analytics tracking (Google Analytics / PostHog)

### ✅ Content Prep

- [ ] HN "Show HN" post (if appropriate)

---

## Phase 2: Launch (Days 2-3)

### Reddit Strategy (Primary Channel)

**Target Subreddits:**
1. r/freelance (450K members) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
2. r/solopreneurs (180K members)
3. r/digitalnomad (1.5M members)
4. r/Fire (700K members)
5. r/povertyfinance (1M members)

**Post Format (NOT salesy):**

**Title Option 1:**
"I analyzed 500+ Reddit posts from freelancers and built a tool to solve the #1 complaint: income anxiety"

**Title Option 2:**
"How do you deal with variable income? I made $12K last month, $2K this month, and my brain is melting"

**Title Option 3:**
"After 3 years of freelancing, I finally solved my biggest problem: unpredictable income"

**Post Body Template:**
```
I've been freelancing for [X] years and the worst part isn't finding clients or doing the work—it's the constant anxiety about whether next month's paycheck will come.

Last month I made $8K. This month I have $2K lined up. My brain is already in panic mode.

I tried YNAB, Mint, every budgeting app. They all assume you have a steady paycheck. They're useless for variable income.

So I built something different: [Brief description of SmoothPay]

[Link to landing page]

I'm not selling anything yet—just trying to validate if this is actually useful to other freelancers. If you're interested, join the waitlist and I'll keep you updated.

Would love feedback from this community. Does this resonate with anyone else?
```

**Posting Rules:**
- Post at 9-11am EST (best engagement)
- Respond to EVERY comment
- Be genuine, not salesy
- Share learning/journey, not just product
- If downvoted, don't repost same day

**Expected Results:**
- 50-200 upvotes per post (if it resonates)
- 10-50 waitlist signups per successful post
- Lots of feedback/validation

### Indie Hackers Strategy

**Post Format:**

**Title:**
"Built a landing page in 12 hours after finding a gap in the freelance finance market"

**Post Body:**
```
Hey IH community,

Yesterday I did deep research on Reddit (r/freelance) and found a massive pain point: freelancers suffer from severe income anxiety because their income is variable ($1K-$10K/month) and all budgeting tools assume steady paychecks.

Used Peter Thiel's Zero-to-One framework to validate this is a real opportunity:
- No direct competition (YNAB/Mint don't solve this)
- 57M+ freelancers in US
- High emotional pain = willingness to pay

Built MVP landing page in 12 hours:
[Link]

Current goal: 100 waitlist signups to validate demand.

Would love feedback from this community. What am I missing?

Tech stack: Next.js, Vercel, Tailwind (will add Supabase for backend)
```

**Expected Results:**
- 5-20 waitlist signups
- Valuable feedback from builders
- Potential collaborators

### Twitter/X Strategy

**Thread Format:**

```
🧵 I spent 10 hours reading Reddit posts from freelancers.

Found a $10B+ problem that NO ONE is solving.

Here's what I learned (and what I'm building):

(1/12)

---

The problem: 57M+ freelancers in the US have severe income anxiety.

Not "I wish I made more money" anxiety.

"Will next month's paycheck come?" anxiety.

(2/12)

---

Example from Reddit (476 upvotes):

"I'm constantly worried that one day I'll just stop getting inquiries and bookings. The uncertainty of how much I'll make each month gives me anxiety."

This isn't rare. It's THE #1 complaint.

(3/12)

---

Why traditional tools don't work:

YNAB/Mint assume you have a steady paycheck.

"Budget what you have" doesn't help when you made $10K last month and $2K this month.

The advice is literally useless.

(4/12)

What I'm building: SmoothPay

Income smoothing platform for freelancers.

• Connect your bank account
• We calculate 12-month average
• Pay you that amount every month
• Automatically smooth out volatility

(5/12)

---

Why this is Zero-to-One (Peter Thiel):

✅ No direct competition
✅ 10x better (not 10% better)
✅ New category (not improvement)
✅ Can monopolize early

Not another budgeting app. A fundamentally different solution.

### Hacker News (Show HN)

**Only if appropriate - HN is selective**

**Title:**
"Show HN: SmoothPay – Income smoothing for freelancers"

**Post:**
```
Hey HN,

I built a landing page for a problem I found researching r/freelance: freelancers have severe income anxiety from variable income.

Problem: Make $10K one month, $2K the next. Traditional budgeting tools assume steady paychecks.

Solution: Income smoothing platform. Connect bank account → calculate 12-month average → pay you that amount monthly.

It's a waitlist right now - validating demand before building MVP.

Tech: Next.js, Vercel, planning Stripe Treasury + Plaid for backend.

Feedback welcome!

## Red Flags (Stop & Pivot)

If after 1 week:

- Adjust positioning or target audience

---

**Paid options (only if traction is strong):**
- Reddit ads: $50-100 (test small)
