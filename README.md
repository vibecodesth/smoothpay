## Problem

Freelancers earn variable income ($1K → $10K → $2K/month). Traditional financial tools assume steady paychecks. This causes:

- 🔥 Severe anxiety ("Will next month's paycheck come?")
- 📉 Feast-or-famine spending patterns
- 😰 Impossible to budget or plan
- 🚫 Hard to get approved for loans/rentals

**57M+ freelancers** in the US suffer from this problem.

## Solution

**SmoothPay = Income Smoothing Platform**

1. Connect your bank account
2. We calculate your 12-month average income
3. You get paid that amount every month
4. High months? Extra stays in account. Low months? We cover the gap.

**Result:** Steady paycheck. Reduced anxiety. Finally budget like a normal person.

## Why This Works (Zero-to-One)

**No direct competition:**
- YNAB/Mint = expense tracking (not income smoothing)
- Banks = don't understand freelancers
- We're creating a new category

**10x Better:**
- Not 10% improvement on budgeting
- Fundamentally solves root cause (income volatility)

**Defensibility:**
- Proprietary smoothing algorithm
- Network effects (more users = better data)
