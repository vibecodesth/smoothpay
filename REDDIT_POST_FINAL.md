## Title:
How do you deal with variable income? I made $12K last month, $2K this month, and my brain is melting

---

## Post Body:

I've been freelancing full-time for 3 years. The work is great. The clients are good. But the income swings are destroying my mental health.

Last month: $12K  
This month: $2K lined up  
Next month: Who the hell knows

My brain is constantly running worst-case scenarios. I check my bank account 5 times a day. I can't commit to a gym membership because "what if next month is slow?" My partner thinks I should get a "real job" because I'm always stressed about money.

I tried every budgeting app. YNAB, Mint, EveryDollar. They all assume you get paid the same amount every month. The advice is "budget what you have" — cool, but that doesn't help when I don't know what I'll have next month.

I'm not broke. I'm making good money overall. But the unpredictability is killing me.

**How do you all handle this?** Do you:
- Just build a massive emergency fund and accept the anxiety?
- Force yourself to take on more clients than you want (just to feel safe)?
- Average your income manually and "pay yourself" from savings?
- Something else I haven't thought of?

I can't be the only one struggling with this.

## EDIT (Add 2-3 hours after posting, once engagement starts):

**Edit:** Wow, I didn't expect this to resonate with so many people. Thank you all for sharing your experiences.

A few of you asked if I found a solution — I actually started building something to solve this exact problem. It's called **SmoothPay** (https://smoothpay-nu.vercel.app).

The idea: Connect your bank account → we calculate your 12-month average income → automatically "pay you" that amount every month. High months? Extra stays in your account. Low months? We smooth it out.

It's just a waitlist right now. I'm trying to validate if other freelancers actually want this or if I'm just solving my own weird problem.

If you're interested, join the waitlist. Or just tell me I'm crazy and should stick to manual spreadsheets. Either is helpful feedback.

## Response Templates

### When someone says "I have the exact same problem":
```
Right?? It's so validating to know I'm not just bad at this.

Quick question: If a tool like SmoothPay existed and worked, what would make you immediately sign up vs. stay skeptical?

Genuinely trying to understand what would build trust for freelancers.
```

### When someone shares their workaround:
```
That's actually clever! [Acknowledge their solution]

The manual version of this is basically what I'm trying to automate. Do you find it takes a lot of mental energy to maintain? Or once set up, it's pretty hands-off?

Asking because I'm trying to figure out if automation actually adds value or if manual is fine.
```

### When someone is skeptical about the product:
```
Totally valid skepticism. 

[Address specific concern]

What would you need to see/know before trusting a platform with your income like this?

I'm in the validation phase, so brutal honesty is way more useful than politeness.
```

### When asked about business model:
```
Great question. Current thinking:

Free tier: Basic income smoothing  
Pro ($15-20/month): Tax withholding, forecasting, Stripe/PayPal integration

But honestly, I'm figuring out if people even want this before worrying about monetization.

Does that pricing seem reasonable if it actually solves the anxiety problem?
```

### When asked about security/trust:
```
Absolutely the right question to ask.

Plan is:
- Partner with a licensed bank (thinking Stripe Treasury)
- FDIC insurance
- Never actually "hold" your money (just facilitate transfers)
- Bank-level encryption

But you're right that trust is the biggest barrier. What would make you comfortable?
```
